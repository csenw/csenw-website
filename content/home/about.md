# About Me
Currently, I am a lecturer in <a target="_blank" href="https://itee.uq.edu.au/">School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE)</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uq.edu.au">the University of Queensland (UQ)</a>. I am also an adjunct senior research fellow in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.griffith.edu.au/institute-integrated-intelligent-systems">Institute for Integrated and Intelligent Systems (IIIS)</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.griffith.edu.au">Griffith University (GU)</a>. Previously, I worked as a lecture of computer science in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/school-information-communication-technology">School of Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</a> in GU from July 2016 to January 2019. I received my PhD degree in UQ in 2014. Between Jan 2014 and July 2016, I have been an ARC post-doctoral research fellow in UQ. 

My research interest includes various topics on Feature Selection, Semi-supervised Learning, Deep Learning, Pattern Recognition, and Data Mining. Also, I have always been concentrating on significant applications using AI and Data Mining techniques, such as health informatics and social media analysis.
